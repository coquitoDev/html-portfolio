<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! <br>
  My name is Oscar but my friends tell me Coquito so you can call me like this. I was born and raised in venezuela, since I was a child I liked video games and baseball, I practiced a lot until I was a teenager.</p>
<p>
  I studied public accounting at the alejandro de humboldt university in caracas, and working in my business area I discovered programming and met love at first sight and now I am here making my first portfolio.
